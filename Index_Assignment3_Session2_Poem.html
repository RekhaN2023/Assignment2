<h1> I’m Nobody! Who are you? </h1> 
<br><br>
<br>I’m Nobody! Who are you?
<br> Are you – Nobody – too?
<br>Then there’s a pair of us!
<br>Don't tell! they'd advertise – you know!
<br><br>
<br>How dreary – to be – Somebody!
<br>How public – like a Frog –
<br>To tell one’s name – the livelong June –
<br>To an admiring Bog!
<br><br><br>
By Emily Dickinson (1891)
